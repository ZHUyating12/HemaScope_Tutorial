# Introduction

HemaScope is a specialized bioinformatics toolkit designed for analyzing both single-cell and spatial transcriptome sequencing data from hematopoietic cells, including myeloid and lymphoid lineages. We have developed an R package named HemaScopeR, a Shiny interface named HemaScopeShiny, and a cloud platform named HemaScopeCloud. 

This tutorial introduces how to install and use the R package and Shiny interface, as well as how to access and operate the cloud platform.
